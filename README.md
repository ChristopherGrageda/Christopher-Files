Welcome to my first PL/SQL project! This repository is a beginner's guide to the basics of PL/SQL, the procedural extension of SQL used in Oracle databases. Through this project, I aim to build a strong foundation in PL/SQL syntax, structure, and functionality, covering topics like:

PL/SQL blocks (Anonymous and Named)

Basic syntax and data types

Simple data manipulation and querying

Writing procedures, functions, and triggers

Error handling and control structures


This project is part of my journey in learning programming and building a professional portfolio. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome as I continue developing my skills!
